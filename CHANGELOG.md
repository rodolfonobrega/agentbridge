# Changelog

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-09

### MCP Timeout & Universal Open Agent Skills Hardening
- **Fix (MCP Timeout):** Resolved critical issue where AgentBridge discarded the `timeout` configuration of MCP servers, causing subagent executions to be abruptly terminated at the 60-second default limit of MCP SDK clients (Claude Code, Pi, IDEs).
  - Added typed `timeout?: number` to `McpServerConfig` and validation in `validateOptions`.
  - Propagated `timeout` across all adapters: Codex (`-c mcp_servers.<name>.timeout=...`), Pi (`mcp.json`), OpenCode (`opencode.json`), Antigravity (`mcp_config.json`), and Claude.
  - Registered `agentbridge` with `"timeout": 300` across all harness configurations (`install`, `setup`, `install-ide` for Cursor, VS Code, Zed, Windsurf, Claude Desktop).
  - Added support for both `timeout` and `timeoutSeconds` in `ask_*` and `dispatch_*` tool schemas.
- **Fix (Skill Collision):** Resolved skill conflict warnings in Pi (`[Skill conflicts] "agentbridge-delegate" collision: auto (project) vs ~/.agents/skills (skipped)`).
  - Adopted `.agents/skills` as the universal canonical Open Agent Skills standard shared across Pi, Codex, OpenCode, and Antigravity.
  - Smart installer now detects existing global installations (`~/.agents/skills`) and avoids writing redundant duplicates to project folders.
  - Setup and harness installers deduplicate skill writes during execution and prevent cross-directory duplicate copies.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-10-09

### Shared Skills, MCPs and Safer Passthrough (learned from Orca and T3 Code)

- **Fix:** `skills` and `mcpPassthrough` were missing from the option allowlist, so `skills: true` failed with `BAD_OPTION`. Both are accepted now.
- **Passthrough is operator-controlled:** `AGENTBRIDGE_MCP_PASSTHROUGH` is the ceiling and a call's `mcpPassthrough` can only narrow it (previously a caller could ask for `*`). Project `.mcp.json` is read as a source, only stdio servers are passed, always `exposure: "direct"`, and Codex now receives the server `env`.
- **Account profiles share resources:** `ab account add` links skills, prompts, plugins, hooks and `AGENTS.md` (never credentials or sessions) and mirrors Codex `[mcp_servers.*]` into the new profile, using NTFS junctions on Windows with a copy fallback. `--no-share` opts out. `--purge` unlinks first so real skills are never deleted.
- **Pi skills:** with `skills: true` the per-run home gets the user's `skills/` linked in; cleanup removes the link before deleting the directory.
- **Skill roots:** project `.agents/skills` and `.claude/skills` are resolved up to the git root; `--worktree` sandboxes copy uncommitted ones (kept out of the diff). `ab doctor` lists the roots and the passthrough state.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-10-09

### MCP Passthrough, Skills Discovery & Host Diagnostics

- **Controlled MCP Passthrough for Subagents:**
  - Implemented `getPassthroughMcpServers()` to allow subagents to inherit specific host MCP servers (e.g. `rea`, `playwright`, database tools) rather than running in total isolation.
  - Granular control via `mcpPassthrough` parameter on `ask_*` / `dispatch_*` tool calls, or persistently via `AGENTBRIDGE_MCP_PASSTHROUGH` and `AGENTBRIDGE_MCP_SOURCE_DIR`.
  - Automatic normalization to `"exposure": "direct"` for Pi harness compatibility.
- **Strict Safety & Offline Gates:**
  - External MCP passthrough is **strictly blocked** when `offline: true` is passed, preventing network or data exfiltration in air-gapped runs.
  - Passthrough is locked down under `read-only` and `plan` permission levels to prevent unprivileged subagents from executing mutating tools.
- **Skills Discovery Support in Pi:**
  - Added support for `skills: true` (and `AGENTBRIDGE_ENABLE_SKILLS=1`), selectively disabling the `-ns` (`--no-skills`) flag in Pi so it can discover shared skills from `~/.agents/skills/`.
- **Host MCP Diagnostics in `ab doctor`:**
  - `ab doctor` now scans and reports host MCP servers configured across all installed harnesses (`pi`, `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `agy`).
  - Added explicit check and warning explaining the default subagent isolation policy.
- **Updated Delegation Skill & AI Documentation:**
  - Expanded `skills/agentbridge-delegate/SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `README_AI.md`, and `docs/REFERENCE.md` with harness isolation architecture and pre-delegation readiness checklists.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-10-09

### Least Privilege Security Architecture & Standardized Configuration (`ab config`)

- **Separation of Permission Ceiling vs Default Execution:**
  - **Permission Ceiling (`ceiling`):** Defaults to `full`. Agents and callers can request any permission level up to `full` without artificial blockage.
  - **Default Execution Permission (`default`):** Defaults to **`read-only`** for maximum safety. Prevents unintended file modifications or destructive shell execution when invoking agents without explicit flags.
  - **Explicit Elevation:** Callers explicitly pass `permissions: "edit"` or `permissions: "full"` when file creation, modifications, or test execution are desired.
- **Unified Configuration Manager (`ab config`):**
  - Project-level (`.agentbridge/config.json`) and user-level (`~/.agentbridge/config.json`) configuration with full precedence.
  - Subcommands: `ab config list`, `ab config get <key>`, `ab config set <key> <val> [--global]`, `ab config reset [key]`.
  - Environment variable overrides: `AGENTBRIDGE_DEFAULT_PERMS` and `AGENTBRIDGE_PERMS_CEILING`.
- **Standardized Endpoints & Ollama Execution:**
  - Completely eliminated special-casing and hidden flags (`defaultPermissions`) across endpoint adapters.
  - Under `read-only` / `plan` (the default), Ollama and HTTP endpoints execute lightning-fast native chat completions with zero file mutation risk.
  - Under `edit` / `full`, endpoints cleanly route to execution harnesses (Claude Code or Pi) with clear installation and setup instructions.
- **Updated Agent Delegation Skills & Documentation:**
  - Synchronized `skills/agentbridge-delegate/SKILL.md` and `README_AI.md` to guide AI agents to explicitly pass `permissions: "edit"` when implementing code or fixing bugs.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-09

### Documentation, Proxy Code Samples & Concurrency Stability

- **Proxy Ready-to-Run Code Examples:** Added comprehensive, production-ready code examples in `docs/PROXY.md`, `README.md`, and `README_AI.md` covering Python (`openai` and `anthropic` SDKs, streaming, LangChain, and Agent Sandbox Mode), TypeScript/Node.js (`openai` and `@anthropic-ai/sdk`), and cURL.
- **AI Agent Integration Reference:** Updated `README_AI.md` with complete MCP checkpoint tools, agent sandbox mode invocation, and practical code snippets for autonomous workflows.
- **Test Suite Concurrency Tuning:** Improved timing assertions in endpoint tests under high concurrency.
- **Synchronized npm Distribution:** Guaranteed identical package parity across GitHub Releases and the official npm registry.

  - Full directory isolation for accounts inspired by Orca (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, etc.).
  - Interactive multi-login commands: `ab account list [agent]`, `ab account add <agent> <name> [--copy-current] [--login]`, `ab account use <agent> <name>`, `ab account remove <agent> <name> [--purge]`.
  - Zero-friction integration with `--account <name>` on CLI runs and automatic conversion to rotating pools for `ab serve --accept-tos-risk`.
  - Proactive per-account quota inspection via `ab account quota [agent]`.
- **Git Hidden-Ref Checkpoint Engine & Visual Time Machine:**
  - Non-destructive workspaces snapshots stored under `refs/agentbridge/checkpoints/` using an isolated `GIT_INDEX_FILE`.
  - Visual Time Machine tab integrated into `ab ui` (`http://127.0.0.1:8788`) with split diff viewing and instant one-click rollback.
  - MCP Bridge tools exposed for AI agents: `checkpoint_create`, `checkpoint_list`, `checkpoint_diff`, `checkpoint_rollback`.
- **TDD Auto-Repair Loop (`ab fix`):**
  - Autonomous test-driven repair loop with bounded stdout/stderr capture.
  - Automated pre-execution checkpointing and safe rollback on persistent failure.
- **Multi-Agent Review Loop & Consensus (`ab review`, `ab ensemble`):**
  - Implementer-reviewer feedback cycles with structured JSON/Markdown verdicts and git diff inspection under `read-only` ceiling.
  - Parallel multi-agent ensemble runs with plurality consensus voting and optional synthesizer judge.
- **DAG Pipeline Task Orchestrator (`ab pipeline`):**
  - Directed Acyclic Graph runner with topological wave execution, concurrency limits, and wave checkpoints.
- **Zero-Friction MCP Installers (`ab install <ide>`):**
  - Instant zero-dependency setup for Cursor, VS Code, Zed, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex, Pi, OpenCode, and Antigravity.
- **Shared Project Memory (`ab memory`):**
  - Machine-readable persistent repository conventions and decisions in `.agentbridge/memory.json`.
- **Proactive Quota Probing (`ab quota`):**
  - Proactive querying of Anthropic OAuth 5-hour/7-day windows and ChatGPT Wham usage limits, auto-throttling credentials at $\ge 95\%$ before encountering HTTP 429 penalties.
- **CommonMark Boundary-Aware Streaming:**
  - Throttled Markdown stream filter ensuring UI/WebSocket streams split only on clean Markdown boundaries (closing code fences, list items, blank lines).
- **Subagent Native Roster:**
  - Complete hierarchical parent-child subagent tree tracking with token usage aggregation and status transitions.
- **Audited 100% Local Privacy Guarantee:**
  - Verified and documented zero remote analytics/tracking policy: all run logs, token counts, and metrics remain on-device in `~/.agentbridge/`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-09

### Smart Model Resolution, Real-Time Active Agent Tracking & Agent Autonomy

- **Smart Model Resolver (`resolvePiModel` & endpoint auto-mapping):** Seamlessly normalizes model names between bare format (`glm-5.3-flash:cloud`) and provider-namespaced format (`ollama/glm-5.3-flash:cloud`) for Pi, Ollama, and custom endpoints. No more 5-minute timeouts on subagent/agent calls.
- **Active Agent Monitoring in Web UI (`ab ui`):**
  - Live header indicator displaying active processes and unique agents (`● X active across Y agents`).
  - Dedicated "Active Agents" KPI card breaking down real-time active runs per agent (e.g. `ollama (2) · pi (1)`).
  - New "Active" status filter tab in the Recent Runs table.
  - Inline error diagnostics directly under badges for failed runs (e.g. `timeout (5m)`, `lost (process exited)`).
  - Subagent count and lineage inspection in the run details drawer.
- **Full Autonomy by Default (`permissions: 'full'`):** Default permissions ceiling across `ab install`, `ab setup`, MCP server bridge, and proxy sandbox updated to `full` so agents and subagents can run tools, shell commands, and builds without being rejected by an arbitrary ceiling.
- **Proxy Bare Model Routing (`ab serve`):** The OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible proxy server now automatically detects and routes bare Ollama model names (like `glm-5.3-flash:cloud`) directly to the Ollama runner.
- **Agent Skill & Onboarding Documentation:**
  - Updated `agentbridge-delegate` skill with smart model resolution and subagent delegation guidance.
  - Added `README_AI.md` / `AGENTS.md` specifying architecture, commands, and workflows for autonomous coding agents.
